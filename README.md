### Creating The Maps

First, we combined the datasets: merging SVI and affordable housing data using spatial joins and relationships in Tableau. We created two maps that visualize:
1. Housing cost burden alongside affordable housing locations.
2. Affordable housing units in relation to minority population percentages.

### Creating The Charts

Then, we created two charts that compare:
1. The number of affordable housing units across different zoning types.
2. The relationship between housing cost burden percentages and crowded housing percentages at the census tract level, exploring whether tracts with higher housing costs also experience higher overcrowding rates, which may signal housing shortages or affordability issues.

### Creating The Dashboard

We included relevant filters across all visualizations that allow a viewer to narrow in on population sizes, zoning types, and public vs. private status of projects. Additionally, we included interactive features such as drill down to specific Wards, and highlights to show tracts in one map when they are hovered over in the other map.
